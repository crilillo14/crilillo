      Welcome to my personal site! I've made this in an attempt to get myself to be more reflexive on my past technical experiences. Checkout my projects and writeups in my <a href="/src/pages/blog/">blog section</a>! 
      </p>

      <p>
      Here you'll see a lot of self learning on statistical learning methods, algorithmic game theory, scientific computing with both python3 and Julia, as well as random miscellaneous projects that I find cool. 
      </p>

      If you're curious about my professional experience and most important technical projects within these realms, feel free to check out the <a href="/">home</a> page.
