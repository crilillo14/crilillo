This is the first post on this blog. It serves as a demonstration of the typography system and overall design aesthetic.

## On Typography

Good typography is invisible. It doesn't call attention to itself but instead serves the reader, making the act of reading effortless and even pleasurable.

> The details are not the details. They make the design.

When designing for long-form content, we should prioritize:

1. **Comfortable line length** — Keeping prose within 72 characters makes reading easier
2. **Generous vertical rhythm** — Adequate spacing between elements reduces cognitive load
3. **Restrained color palette** — A single accent color is often enough

### Code Examples

Here's a simple TypeScript function:

```typescript
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

const message = greet('World');
console.log(message);
```

Inline code like `const x = 42` should blend seamlessly with the surrounding text.

## Looking Ahead

This blog will serve as a place for longer-form writing on topics ranging from software engineering to design to whatever else captures my attention.
