I've noticed my IG reels have felt off in the last year or two. Not in the day to day, but in the month to month, the year by year. Memes have been getting more *turbulent*, AI is predominant, and the dead internet theory makes more sense than ever. 

Why would anyone care but me about this? Good question. Becuase I believe, in some way, this very braindead habit of mine somehow relates to a more global phenomena that is very well known -- the decreasing attention span of the general population. And as a corrolary to this, a very key insight arises that gives an edge on *attention markets*: a phenomena I call narrative death.

Taking you back to the mid to late 2010s, IG content was very clear cut -- the hottest memes, trends, dances, celebs, all clearly defined for anyone. There were a few memepages that were isomoprhic to news outlets, and these controlled meme narratives, for lack of a better term. Damn daniel was a good one, Ugandan Knuckes was another. I could go on, but that's not what matters. What is important for my hypothesis is this: the attention function of any one meme would tend to always be **bimodal**. I'm not so sure that is the case now.


Why?
